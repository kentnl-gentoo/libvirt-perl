=head1 NAME

Sys::Virt - Represent and manage a libvirt hypervisor connection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $vmm = Sys::Virt->new(address => $addr);

  my @domains = $vmm->list_domains();

  foreach my $dom (@domains) {
    print "Domain ", $dom->get_id, " ", $dom->get_name, "\n";
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Sys::Virt module provides a Perl XS binding to the libvirt
virtual machine management APIs. This allows machines running
within arbitrary virtualization containers to be managed with
a consistent API.

=head1 ERROR HANDLING

Any operations in the Sys::Virt API which have failure scenarios
will result in an instance of the L<Sys::Virt::Error> module being
thrown. To catch these errors, simply wrap the method in an eval
block. For details of the information contained in the error objects,
consult the L<Sys::Virt::Error> manual page.

Attach to the virtual machine monitor with the address of C<address>. The
uri parameter may be omitted, in which case the default connection made
will be to the local Xen hypervisor. Some example URIs include:

=over 4

=item xen:///

Xen on the local machine

=item test:///default

Dummy "in memory" driver for test suites

=item qemu:///system

System-wide driver for QEMU / KVM virtualization

=item qemu:///session

Per-user driver for QEMU virtualization

=item qemu+tls://somehost/system

System-wide QEMU driver on C<somehost> using TLS security

=item xen+tcp://somehost/

If the optional C<readonly> parameter is supplied, then an unprivileged
connection to the VMM will be attempted. If it is not supplied, then it
defaults to making a fully privileged connection to the VMM. If the
calling application is not running as root, it may be neccessary to
provide authentication callbacks.

If the optional C<auth> parameter is set to a non-zero value,
authentication will be enabled during connection, using the
default set of credential gathering callbacks. The default
callbacks prompt for credentials on the console, so are not
suitable for graphical applications. For such apps a custom
implementation should be supplied. The C<credlist> parameter
should be an array reference listing the set of credential
types that will be supported. The credential constants in
this module can be used as values in this list. The C<callback>
parameter should be a subroutine reference containing the
code neccessary to gather the credentials. When invoked it
will be supplied with a single parameter, a array reference
of requested credentials. The elements of the array are
hash references, with keys C<type> giving the type of
credential, C<prompt> giving a user descriptive user
prompt, C<challenge> giving name of the credential
required. The answer should be collected from the user, and
returned by setting the C<result> key. This key may already
be set with a default result if applicable

As a simple example returning hardcoded credentials

=item my $xml = $vmm->find_storage_pool_sources($type, $srcspec, $flags)

Probe for available storage pool sources for the pool of type C<$type>.
The C<$srcspec> parameter can be C<undef>, or a parameter to refine the
discovery process, for example a server hostname for NFS discovery. The
C<$flags> parameter can usually be left as zero. The return scalar is
an XML document describing the discovered storage pool sources.

=item $vmm->restore_domain($savefile)

Recreate a domain from the saved state file given in the C<$savefile> parameter.

=item $vmm->get_max_vcpus($domtype)

Return the maximum number of vcpus that can be configured for a domain
of type C<$domtype>

=item my $hostname = $vmm->get_hostname()

Return the name of the host with which this connection is associated.

=item my $uri = $vmm->get_uri()

Return the URI associated with the open connection. This may be different
from the URI used when initially connecting to libvirt, when 'auto-probing'
or drivers occurrs.

=item my $type = $vmm->get_type()

Return the type of virtualization backend accessed by this VMM object. Currently
the only supported type is C<Xen>.

=item my $xml = $vmm->domain_xml_from_native($format, $config);

Convert the native hypervisor configuration C<$config> which is in format
<$format> into libvirrt domain XML. Valid values of C<$format> vary between
hypervisor drivers.

=item my $config = $vmm->domain_xml_to_native($format, $xml)

Convert the libvirt domain XML configuration C<$xml> to a native hypervisor
configuration in format C<$format>

=item my $ver = $vmm->get_version()

Return the complete version number as a string encoded in the
formula C<(major * 1000000) + (minor * 1000) + micro>.

=item my $ver = $vmm->get_major_version

Return the major version number of the libvirt library.

=cut

sub get_major_version {
    my $self = shift;
    my $ver = $self->get_version;
    return ($ver - ($ver % 1000000))/1000000;

=item my $ver = $vmm->get_minor_version

Return the minor version number of the libvirt library.

=cut

sub get_minor_version {
    my $self = shift;
    my $ver = $self->get_version;
    my $mver = $ver % 1000000;
    return ($mver - ($mver % 1000)) / 1000;
}

=item my $ver = $vmm->get_micro_version

Return the micro version number of the libvirt library.

=cut

sub get_micro_version {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->get_version % 1000;
}

sub get_version {

=pod

=item my $info = $con->get_node_info()

Returns a hash reference summarising the capabilities of the host
node. The elements of the hash are as follows:

=item $conn->domain_event_register($callback)

Register a callback to received notificaitons of domain state change
events. Only a single callback can be registered with each connection
instance. The callback will be invoked with four paramters, an
instance of C<Sys::Virt> for the connection, an instance of C<Sys::Virt::Domain>
for the domain changing state, and a C<event> and C<detail> arguments,
corresponding to the event constants defined in the C<Sys::Virt::Domain>
module. Before discarding the connection object, the callback must be
deregistered, otherwise the connection object memory will never be
released in garbage collection.

=item $conn->domain_event_deregister()

Unregister a callback, allowing the connection object to be garbage
collected.

=over 4

=item memory

The amount of physical memory in the host

=item model

The model of the CPU, eg x86_64

=item cpus

The total number of logical CPUs

=item mhz

The peak MHZ of the CPU

=item nodes

The number of NUMA cells

=item sockets

The number of CPU sockets

=item cores

The number of cores per socket

=item threads

The number of threads per core

=back

=item my $info = $con->get_node_security_model()

Returns a hash reference summarising the security model of the
host node. There are two keys in the hash, C<model> specifying
the name of the security model (eg 'selinux') and C<doi>
specifying the 'domain of interpretation' for security labels.

=item my $xml = $con->get_capabilities();

Returns an XML document describing the hypervisor capabilities

=item $mem = $con->get_node_free_memory();

Returns the current free memory on the host

=item @mem = $con->get_node_cells_free_memory($start, $end);

Returns the free memory on each NUMA cell between C<$start> and C<$end>.

=head1 BUGS

Hopefully none, but the XS code needs to be audited to ensure it
is not leaking memory.
